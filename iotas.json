We challenge sensationalism and polarization in our civic and political discourse by offering online tools to power widespread, cross-partisan discourse and a channel for better communication between candidates and voters to support better decision-making at the ballot box.\n\n### Why Discourse Works\n\nEnCiv draws on decades of research into the principles of human interaction, civic discourse, dialogue and deliberation, and constructive decision-making. This research teaches us that well designed discussion processes that facilitate everyone speaking and listening yield the best results.\n\nWhile it’s easy to assume that online connection is inferior to live interactions in fostering respect and constructive collaboration, we believe the opposite. When supported by systems designed with neutrality in mind, online discourse has the potential to establish a higher bar for universally respectful, broadly inclusive conversation — ultimately driving positive results.\n\n### The EnCiv Team\n\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/hf6mryjpf/image/upload/c_crop,g_faces:center,h_320,w_320/v1715289413/assets/DavidFridley_320x400_dv2xnt.jpg\" style=\"width:8rem; float: left;margin-top:1.5rem;margin-right:1.5rem\"><p><b>David Fridley</b> CEO, Chairperson of the Board, CTO.

    "description": "##We’re building tech tools for a better democracy.\n\nAs cultural polarization and sensationalism continue to threaten civic discourse, we see a technological opportunity. Our tools provide an alternative to current discourse and political education processes, fostering productive discourse in a way that will ultimately drive better decision making.\n\nWe currently have two tools available: Undebates and Civil Pursuit. Join our mailing list to stay informed of our new product releases.\n\n###Undebates\n\nMore Informed Decisions at the Ballot Box\n\n---\n\n**Problem**: Whether it's the school board or the student council, it's hard for voters to really understand the candidates’ positions on the questions that matter most. Written information is scattered across the internet and any media coverage is short and sensationalized. And for candidates, it can be almost impossible to get honest media coverage if they’re not running for president.\n\n**Solution:** Undebates is a tool that automatically produces video debates by automatically interviewing candidates through their web browser. Instead of sitting through debates or combing through news articles, hear the candidates’ position on the policies you care about most, straight from them and make your own informed voting decisions.\n\nDemocratically-run organizations and political candidates at any level can create their own Undebates with a few simple steps.\n\n<ActionButton style=\"lineHeight:6rem;\" action=\"https://cc.enciv.org/undebates\">See Undebates in Action</ActionButton>\n\n###Civil Pursuit\n\nLarge Scale Deliberative Discussion\n\n---\n\n**Problem:** How can thousands of people across the city, state, and country discuss tough political issues productively - meaning discussions resulting in solutions they all support - rather than the polarization and gridlock we see from politics today?\n\n**Solution:** We are building tools for productive democratic deliberation online, based on practices that have been proven through in-person dialog and deliberation. With Civil Pursuit, you can browse a series of burning questions in our current political ecosystem, and participate in structured discussions with people across the country that are designed to organize, rather than suppress, differing opinions and delve into what's valuable in each that lead to unifying solutions with national support.\n\n<ActionButton style=\"margin-top:2rem\">Coming Soon</ActionButton>\n\n",

This new, non-partisan deliberation offers a chance to step away from the noise and **find what unites us.**\n\nJoin people from across the entire political spectrum—conservatives, liberals, and everyone in between—for one essential purpose: to collaboratively draft a single, shared, **concise** Vision Statement on the fundamental role and purpose of our government.\n\nThis is not a debate about policy or personalities. This is a foundational conversation about **principles** that will become the basis of further deliberations.\n\nMove beyond gridlock. Write the **Mission Statement** for the next generation—your perspective isn't just heard; it's written into the core text.\n\nInvest some time. Help define the mission that **unites** us.",

    "description": "### **Your unique perspective is the starting point.**\n\nMost platforms want you to react. We want you to **lead.** We are often told our country is \"lost,\" but the truth is we simply **aren’t looking at the same map.** We need your unfiltered, honest vision—no matter how out-of-the-box or \"awkward\" it may feel. Sometimes the ideas that seem unconventional at first are the ones that spark a breakthrough for everyone else.\n\n#### **The Process: The \"First 500\" Tournament**\nWe are looking for 500 **distinct voices** to launch this deliberation. Once we hit that threshold, the process begins:\n\n1.  **The Initial View:** You will see and rank a selection of 8 ideas (including yours).\n2.  **The Deep Dive:** You will then deliberate on the 8 highest-ranked ideas from that round.\n3.  **The Consensus:** You will focus on the top-tier ideas to see which direction has the strongest potential to unite us all.\n4.  **The Reveal:** We will share the final results with all participants and the public, creating a clear signal of where we can go together.\n\n**Beyond the Pilot:** Everyone in the \"First 500\" will be invited to participate in—and help shape—future, larger-scale deliberations as we grow.\n\n#### **What to share now:**\n* **The Direction:** In your view, what is the path our country should take?\n* **The Case for Unity:** Why do you believe this is a direction that—once understood—the rest of the country could (or should) unite behind?\n\n#### **The Big Picture: Scaling a New Democracy**\nToday, you are a pioneer of a new civic infrastructure. We are proving the model with 500 people, but **the goal is to scale to thousands, then millions, and eventually the whole country.** Imagine a future where \"the will of the people\" isn't a guess by a pollster, but a clear, deliberated direction we have defined together.\n\n> **Note:** Responses are not shown until we hit 500 participants. This ensures each vision is an **original perspective**, uninfluenced by what anyone else has written.",
