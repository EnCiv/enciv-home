We challenge sensationalism and polarization in our civic and political discourse by offering online tools to power widespread, cross-partisan discourse and a channel for better communication between candidates and voters to support better decision-making at the ballot box.\n\n### Why Discourse Works\n\nEnCiv draws on decades of research into the principles of human interaction, civic discourse, dialogue and deliberation, and constructive decision-making. This research teaches us that well designed discussion processes that facilitate everyone speaking and listening yield the best results.\n\nWhile it’s easy to assume that online connection is inferior to live interactions in fostering respect and constructive collaboration, we believe the opposite. When supported by systems designed with neutrality in mind, online discourse has the potential to establish a higher bar for universally respectful, broadly inclusive conversation — ultimately driving positive results.\n\n### The EnCiv Team\n\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/hf6mryjpf/image/upload/c_crop,g_faces:center,h_320,w_320/v1715289413/assets/DavidFridley_320x400_dv2xnt.jpg\" style=\"width:8rem; float: left;margin-top:1.5rem;margin-right:1.5rem\"><p><b>David Fridley</b> CEO, Chairperson of the Board, CTO.

    "description": "##We’re building tech tools for a better democracy.\n\nAs cultural polarization and sensationalism continue to threaten civic discourse, we see a technological opportunity. Our tools provide an alternative to current discourse and political education processes, fostering productive discourse in a way that will ultimately drive better decision making.\n\nWe currently have two tools available: Undebates and Civil Pursuit. Join our mailing list to stay informed of our new product releases.\n\n###Undebates\n\nMore Informed Decisions at the Ballot Box\n\n---\n\n**Problem**: Whether it's the school board or the student council, it's hard for voters to really understand the candidates’ positions on the questions that matter most. Written information is scattered across the internet and any media coverage is short and sensationalized. And for candidates, it can be almost impossible to get honest media coverage if they’re not running for president.\n\n**Solution:** Undebates is a tool that automatically produces video debates by automatically interviewing candidates through their web browser. Instead of sitting through debates or combing through news articles, hear the candidates’ position on the policies you care about most, straight from them and make your own informed voting decisions.\n\nDemocratically-run organizations and political candidates at any level can create their own Undebates with a few simple steps.\n\n<ActionButton style=\"lineHeight:6rem;\" action=\"https://cc.enciv.org/undebates\">See Undebates in Action</ActionButton>\n\n###Civil Pursuit\n\nLarge Scale Deliberative Discussion\n\n---\n\n**Problem:** How can thousands of people across the city, state, and country discuss tough political issues productively - meaning discussions resulting in solutions they all support - rather than the polarization and gridlock we see from politics today?\n\n**Solution:** We are building tools for productive democratic deliberation online, based on practices that have been proven through in-person dialog and deliberation. With Civil Pursuit, you can browse a series of burning questions in our current political ecosystem, and participate in structured discussions with people across the country that are designed to organize, rather than suppress, differing opinions and delve into what's valuable in each that lead to unifying solutions with national support.\n\n<ActionButton style=\"margin-top:2rem\">Coming Soon</ActionButton>\n\n",

The one issue that everyone from across the political spectrum would agree has a positive impact. Then we can solve it and move on to the next one.\n\nTake a moment and think about it, but don't over think your answer at this point. You will probably have a new perspective after this. This is just the beginning.\n\nThis is not a survey, this is a new kind of tool that is designed to help us discuss our ideas and productively converge on what unites us.\n\nAfter expressing your views, you will get to see others, and you will get to say why some are more or less important to discuss further. And you will get to see what others say as well. Then after each round we will invite you back to be part of the next one, considering the most unifying ideas from the previous round, until we converge on the conclusions that unite us.\n\nThis is a new tool, early in its development and we invite you to provide feedback along the way so we can keep making it better.",
